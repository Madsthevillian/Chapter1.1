    <p>1.1 Nontext Content
        This section discusses how to provide text alternatives for nontext content like images, videos, and other media types. The aim is to ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can access the content. For example, images may have alternative text (alt text) that screen readers can interpret, and videos may have captions or transcripts for those with hearing impairments.</p>

    <p>1.2 Time-based Media
        This section covers time-based media (like video and audio content) and how to provide alternatives for users who may not be able to see or hear the media. These alternatives include captions for videos, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.</p>

    <p>1.3 Adaptable Content
        This part provides guidance on making content adaptable to various sensory characteristics. It focuses on ensuring that important information isn't conveyed solely through sensory characteristics like size, shape, color, or sound. This way, all users can perceive and understand the information regardless of their specific needs.</p>

    <p>1.4 Distinguishable Content (See and Hear)
        This section talks about making web content easy to see and hear by adjusting visual and auditory elements. It includes recommendations for sufficient contrast between text and background, larger text sizes for readability, and controlling background audio so that it doesn't interfere with the userâ€™s ability to hear the main content.</p>
